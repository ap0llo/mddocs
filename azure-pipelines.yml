# Pipeline consists of 4 jobs
# - Build_an_Test: 
#   - Builds the project
#   - Runs all the tests
#   - creates a NuGet package
# - Publish_to_MyGet: 
#   - Pushes the NuGet package to MyGet 
#   - Assumes a Service Connection for MyGet was set up in the Team project running the pipeline
#   - The name of the service connection is stored in the variable myget_ServiceConnectionName (defined below)
#   - Only runs when building a release branch or the master branch
# -Publish_to_NuGet_org
#   - Pushes the NuGet package to NuGet.org 
#   - Assumes a Service Connection for NuGet was set up in the Team project running the pipeline
#   - The name of the service connection is stored in the variable nuget_org_ServiceConnectionName (defined below)
#   - The variable nuget_org_PackageName defines which package is produced by the pipeline
#   - Whether this step runs can be controlled by the variable 'Settings.PublishToNuGetOrg' (modify at queue time when necessary):
#     - 'auto' or empty: Publish to NuGet.org when building a release branch
#     - 'false': Do not publish to NuGet.org
#     - 'true': Publish to NuGet.org
# - Create_GitHub_Release
#   - Creates a GitHub release for the build
