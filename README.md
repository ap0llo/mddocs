*MdDocs* is a tool to generate documentation in the form of Markdown documents.
It currently supports:

- Generating API reference from a .NET assembly and the corresponding XML documentation file
- Generating command line help for projects that use the [CommandLineParser package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommandLineParser/) for parsing
  
For an example of what the output looks like, have a look at the [demoprojects](docs/demoprojects) directory.

## Documentation

For documentation on installation and usage, please refer to the
corresponding sub-pages:

- [MdDocs .NET CLI Tool](./docs/net-cli-tool.md)
- [MdDocs MSBuild Integration](./docs/msbuild-integration.md)
- [Configuration](./docs/configuration/README.md)

## Building from source

â„¹ This repository uses git submodules. Use `git clone --recursive` to check out submodules as well.

Building MdDocs from source requires the .NET 7 SDK (at lease version 7.0.101 as specified in [global.json](./global.json)) and uses [Cake](https://cakebuild.net/) for the build.

To run tests, the .NET 6 SDK and a installation of Visual Studio 2022 is requried as well.
(this only applies to the `MdDocs.MSBuild.IntegrationTest` project, all other test project should be executable with only the .NET 7 SDK).

To execute the default task, run

```ps1
.\build.ps1
```

This will build the project, run all tests and pack the NuGet package.


## Issues

If you run into any issues or if you are missing a feature, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/ap0llo/mddocs/issues).

I'm also using issues as a backlog of things that come into my mind or things I plan to implement, so don't be surprised if many issues were created by me without anyone else being involved in the discussion.

## Versioning and Branching

The version of the library is automatically derived from git and the information in `version.json` using [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning):

- The master branch  always contains the latest version. Packages produced from master are always marked as pre-release versions (using the `-pre` suffix).
- Stable versions are built from release branches. Build from release branches will have no `-pre` suffix
- Builds from any other branch will have both the `-pre` prerelease tag and the git commit hash included in the version string

To create a new release branch use the [`nbgv` tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nbgv/):

```ps1
dotnet tool install --global nbgv
nbgv prepare-release
```
